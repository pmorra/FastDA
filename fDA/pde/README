Compressible Navier-Stokes discretized according to a SBP-SAT scheme are marched in time with JCODE.
The time discretization is 4th-order Runge-Kutta in time and SBP 4-2 in space.

This folder contains the source files of the code.

The simulations were performed with MPI on 576 processes for about 5 hourse wall-clock time on the HPC cluster of Johns Hopkins University.

The inflow boundary conditions are the vector sampled with LHS.
